## nand2browser

Implementation of projects from [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) & [fromthetransistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor).

- `basic_lgs/`: Implementation of basic logic gates like NOT, AND, XOR, etc using NAND in `.hdl`.
- `ALU`: Implementation of a basic Arithmetic Logical Unit(ALU) which for a given input x, y along with some opcodes, could compute operations like: !x, !y, x+1, y+1, x+y, x&y, x|y, etc.
